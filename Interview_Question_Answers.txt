1. Difference between FileReader and BufferedReader?
FileReader reads character-by-character. BufferedReader wraps FileReader and reads larger chunks, making it faster.

2. What is try-with-resources?
A Java feature that automatically closes resources like files after use.

3. How to handle IOException?
Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle the IOException or declare it using throws.

4. What are checked and unchecked exceptions?
Checked: Handled at compile-time (e.g., IOException). Unchecked: Runtime exceptions (e.g., NullPointerException).

5. How does file writing work in Java?
Using classes like FileWriter or BufferedWriter to write data to a file.

6. What is the difference between append and overwrite mode?
Append: adds data to the end of the file. Overwrite: clears the file and writes new data.

7. What is exception propagation?
When an exception moves up the call stack from one method to another until it's caught or crashes the program.

8. How to log exceptions?
Use System.err.println, or better, use logging frameworks like Log4j or java.util.logging.

9. What is a stack trace?
A stack trace shows the method call hierarchy when an exception occurs, useful for debugging.

10. When to use finally block?
To execute code (like closing resources) regardless of whether an exception occurred.
